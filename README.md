Sketch My Thing!
==================

A simple multiplayer online game, in which computer assigns a random word to one player who is supposed to "sketch" the word while the others try to guess it within limited time.
Then the turn for sketching goes to the next player and so on.

Note
------
I have hosted the project on IITB CSE server, which doesn't allow DB-access. So, right now, all data is stored and retrieved only through FileIO only!
I will switch to MySQL once I complete coding this.
